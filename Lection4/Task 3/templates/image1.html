        bounty hunters
        in the nation massing on their heels, the gang must rob, steal and fight their way across the rugged heartland
        of America in order to survive. As deepening internal divisions threaten to tear the gang apart, Arthur must
        make a choice between his own ideals and loyalty to the gang who raised him.</p>
